    <p> <strong>JavaScript</strong>
        (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class
        functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser
        environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports
        object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. <br>
        JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on
        the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for
        controlling web page behavior.</p>
